In the current section we present the SALSA SCPool. We first show the data structures of SALSA in Section~\ref{alg-structure}, and then present the basic algorithm without stealing support in Section~\ref{alg-overview}. The stealing procedure is described in Section~\ref{alg-stealing}, finally, the role of chunk pools is presented in Section~\ref{alg-pools}. For the simplicity of presentation, in this section we assume that the the memory accesses satisfy sequential consistency~\cite{Lamport:SC}, we describe the ways to solve memory reordering issues in Section~\ref{sec:memory-order}.
