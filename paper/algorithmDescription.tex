In the current section we present SALSA implementation for an SCPool API described above.
We first show the data structures of SALSA in Section~\ref{alg-structure}, we then present the general overview 
of the algorithm in Section~\ref{alg-overview}, and the stealing procedure is described in Section~\ref{alg-stealing}. 
We finally demonstrate that SALSA is lock-free and starvation in Section~\ref{alg-properties}.
