	\STATE steal(SCPool from) \elcomment{Tries to steal a number of tasks from the given pool and move them to the current pool. Returns one of the stolen tasks or $\bot$. }%We guarantee that if there are tasks in the \emph{from} pool at the beginning of steal invocation, then either steal function returns a task, or there is another thread that returns a task during the steal execution.}
