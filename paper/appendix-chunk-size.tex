Figure~\ref{fig:chunk-size} shows the influence of chunk size on system throughput for the chunk-based algorithms SALSA, SALSA+CAS and ConcBags in a $16/16$ workload. 
SALSA variations achieve their best throughput for large chunks with $1000$ tasks ($\sim8$KB size in $64$-bit architectures). The optimal chunk for ConcBags includes $128$ tasks. We believe that ConcBags is ineffective with large chunk sizes since its consumers linearly scan a chunk when seeking a task to steal. In contrast, SALSA keeps the index of the latest consumed task in the chunk node, and therefore its consume operations terminate in $O(1)$ steps for every chunk size. 
In our evaluation in section~\ref{sec:evaluation} we used optimal chunk sizes for each algorithm.
