The local variables and algorithms of the producer appear in
Algorithm~\ref{alg:producer-non-fifo}. The producer's code is fairly simple, the producer first
attempt to add tasks to the chunks it previously used, if this is the first produce action or the
previous chunk was already filled, the producer will attempt to take a chunk from the chunk pool and
add it to its list on the pool of the given consumer. If the pool is empty the operation will fail
with a FULL message, if produceForce was called the operation will not fail, instead a new chunk
will be allocated.
